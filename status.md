Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I made a my text file of words to use in the game. I also made the backgound and layout using pygame. I am trying to learn the basics of pygame to work on the game. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to work of the actual game where players can enter the word and get feedback from it. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am struggling with navigating pygame and making the actual game with python. Without pygame, making the wordle directly in python is easy but working with pygame is a little tedious and tricky.
