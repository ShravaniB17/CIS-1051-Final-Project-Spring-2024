# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Wordle lite

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A word guessing game that will show you which letters are/ are not a part of the four-letter final word.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

There will be a bank of four letter words. The software will select a random word that the player has to guess in 6 turns. Every time the player enters a guess, the game will give a feedback on what letters could potentially be a part of the final word. If a letter is highlighted yellow, the letter is used in the final answer but it is in the wrong spot. If it if highlighted green, the letter is in the correct spot. If it is highlighted gray, the letter is not used anywhere in the final word. If the player guesses the word in under six tries, the round stops there and a congratulations message will show up. On the other hand, if they don't get it, the game will show them the correct answer and a "better luck next time" message. The player can play multiple rounds and compare their scores based on how many turns it took them to get the answer. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A word guessing game that can give feedback after each turn on which letter is used in the final answer. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game can also show if the letter is in the correct place or not. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It can also let the players play multiple rounds and give points for each round and have a high score. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to make a list of words in a text file most probably that the game can read and choose from. I will have to download pygame. I will need to learn how to make the game's layout as close to the real one as possible. I will also need a way to get feedback everytime the player presses "enter" after every guess. I will probably have to make different functions for all of these steps.
